## ManageIQ Container 

This directory contains 
1. ManageIQBuildContainerProcess.md - Readme file documenting a process to build 
   a manageiq container.
2. stitchcontainer.sh - Script to build ManageIQ Container.
 
It can work with both public and private manageiq repos. However we have to enable
Personal Access Token in the git so all the manageiq repos required to build the 
container can be cloned.

In stitchcontainer.sh default values of the various repos are set as
  ```
  MANAGEIQ_ADDR=https://$CI_USER_TOKEN@github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq.git
  MANAGEIQ_RPM_ADDR=https://$CI_USER_TOKEN@github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-rpm_build.git
  MANAGEIQ_PODS_ADDR=https://$CI_USER_TOKEN@github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-pods.git
  ```
where CI_USER_TOKEN is Personal Access Token as generated by the git. These values can be 
changed to personal forks of the branches.

Please note that the options.yml file used by manageiq-rpm_build process  is generated by 
stitchcontainer.sh. It contains both the git address of manageiq and the branch to be 
downloaded (currently set to master).
